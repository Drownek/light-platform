# light-platform

A platform library for creating Minecraft plugins with ease.


## üöÄ About This Project

This library includes a lightweight, Spring-Boot-like class management system:
- It uses reflection to scan the project tree for annotated classes and automatically injects them into a simple dependency container.
- Other components can then easily access and use these injected classes ‚Äî making development more modular, clean, and intuitive.

This project uses code from [okaeri-platform](https://github.com/OkaeriPoland/okaeri-platform), originally created by Dawid Sawicki.

Significant changes have been made, including:

- Moving from Maven to Gradle
- Adding [LiteCommands](https://github.com/Rollczi/LiteCommands) support in place of okaeri-commands
- Modified serdes for better ItemStack support
- And some other features to speed up plugin development even more.

Also, my own [bukkit-utils](https://github.com/Drownek/bukkit-utils) are bundled with the platform
